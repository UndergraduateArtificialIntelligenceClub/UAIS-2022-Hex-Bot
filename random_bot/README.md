# Example bot program

This is an example of a hex bot that conforms to spec written in python 3. Feel
free to use it as a boilerplate. This bot has pretty much 0 artificial
intelligence, it just chooses a valid position at random

# Examples

```bash
./main.py --help  # Print cli help

python3 main.py black  # Run as black tiles
./main.py white        # Run as white tiles
```
